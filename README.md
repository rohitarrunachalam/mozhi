### Overview
A Web Application based Sign Language to Speech and vice-versa conversion tool that helps in bridging the communication gap between deaf-mute and normal
people.


### Solution
- Our solution to this problem is an AI assistance for sign language tool that works based on computer vision and machine learning using technologies like OpenCV,Mediapipe,BERT,Streamlit.etc
- The tool gets the sign language gesture performed by the person as input from the camera and converts that into speech.SImilarly , it converts text to Indian sign language gestures.
- Weâ€™ve trained the ML model using the SVM algorithm.
- We have also added features like word autocomplete,Next word prediction and Backspacing
